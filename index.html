							This Android App manages your school grades. You can add, change
							and delete subjects and grades. You have the average always in
							view, which considers the weighting of your grades. The stave
							goes from one to ten.<br>Furthermore, it will allow you to
							export your subjects and grades and import it at a later time.
							Thus it's possible to transfer your subjects and grades to
							another device.

						<p>
							&quot;Image Compress&quot; can compress your images (*.jpg;
							*.jpeg; *.png; *.gif; *.bmp). Once you have selected a picture
							the program will show it and you can change the quality. The
							image will update live and you can visit the effect of the
							compression.<br>Another possibility is to save the
							compressed pictures. The lower the quality, the lower the memory
							requirement of the picture. You can save up to 2200% storage.

							You want to play a round Tic Tac Toe? This simple implementation
							is built according to the client/server model, which makes is
							possible to play Tic Tac Toe above two computers in the same
							network. It's also possible to play at one computer.<br> A
							special feature is that you can choose the size of the field: You
							can play the classic Tic Tac Toe with 3x3 and you can increase
							the size up to 10x10 where you need to have 10 in a row to win

						<h2>Download Site</h2>
						<p>
							This site is only a little site with few things to show.
							The highlight is that it is made of a RWD (Responsive Web
							Design). This means that the layout of this site scales
							automatically from phones to tablets to desktops. <br> To
							realize this project I used the &quot;Twitter Bootstrap&quot;
							Framework. Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS
							framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the
							web.

							Runnergy is an Android application, which is able to record an
							activity, which you covered during a sporting activity, for
							example, running or cycling. Before you start, you tell the app
							to start tracking your activity and when you are finished,
							Runnergy calculates the distance and the average speed and lets
							you view the route on a map. <br>If you decide to do the
							same activity one more time, you can compete against yourself.
